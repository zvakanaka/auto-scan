It clicks things and names files (starting at 0.png) for you because scanning 100+ photos manually is just too tedious.

# Instructions
1. Open [Document Scanner](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan) in Linux.
2. Place your photo(s) on the scanner bed.
3. Open a terminal and run `scan.sh` from the directory you want your photos to be scanned into.
4. Wait for scan to complete.
5. Replace the photos onthe scanner bed with the next photo(s).
6. Press enter (your terminal window should have been automatically focused).
